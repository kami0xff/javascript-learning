let message = "secret message"; //block scoped variable
var name = "name"; //non block scoped variable

let hello = message; //COPY the content of message into hello

// let message = "another message" declaring twice the same name is an error

//case matters and non latin characters like chinese characters are allowed but not recommended

//there are some reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable names and variable names cannot start with numbers

//whithout use strict assignment without declaration is technically possible 
// foo = "baz";


const BIRTHDAY = "24/01/1998";
//const variables cannot be reasigned 
//convention to write constants in uppercase

//there are two types of constants ones that are known prior to the execution of the script 
//and ones that are set during the runtime of the script. typically we use the all uppercase for the ones 
//that are known prior to the execution of the script
