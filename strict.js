//For a long time Javascript evolved without compatibility issues. new features where added 
//to the language while the old stuff did not change    
    //this had the benefit of never breaking existing code
    //But the downside was that any mistake made by the javascript language developers was stuck in teh language forever


//using this enables the modern javascript features 
//that where introduced in 2009 ES5 and above that modified some existing behavior 
"use strict";
//if we use classes and modules it is enabled for us
